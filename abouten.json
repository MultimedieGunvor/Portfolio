"content1": "I have a passion for communication and linguistic oddities, which contributes to my interest in the languages of code. I also love to create something from scratch, be it web design or one of my hobbies. Creating is, in my opinion, a fantastic way to express yourself.",
"content2": "I am always open to opportunities for honing my skills and learning new techniques that I can use in my projects. By nature, I am detail oriented, and I enjoy immersing myself in a project until it is complete.",
"content3": "My work for a small company in Aarhus has taught me how to navigate in a professional setting, as well as honed my ability to engage in productive customer dialogue, and it has provided me with e-commerce admin experience using Wordpress and Woo Commerce.",
