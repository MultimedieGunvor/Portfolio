My ability to manage a big project by breaking it into a series of manageable tasks is one of my strongest skills in a professional setting, and I thrive when I have a concrete deadline to work towards. My project experience collecting and working with empirical data about users and user scenarios from project: Jeweller Henrik Saugbjerg has helped me develop a wider understanding of users and target groups, which I will use for future projects. This project has also added to my proficiency in JavaScript and JSON. I truly enjoy the process of designing – playing around with layout, colours, effects etc. – and I love the challenge of translating a design into code. It is so satisfying to build something from scratch to a working product. I also like the challenge inherent in adapting a product for multiple platforms. It demands workshopping your design for maximum scalability. Personally, I am driven by a need to keep learning, and to create interesting designs which are inviting, intuitive, and easy to use.",
